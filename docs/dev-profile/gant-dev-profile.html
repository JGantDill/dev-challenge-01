	<h3>Blurbing about myself:</h3>
	
	<p>
	  I am Jeffery Dill, but I go by my middle name of Gant and I am from Russellville, AL. <br>
	  I love Jesus, my family, nerdy stuff(Star Wars, comic books, etc), sports(particularly college football and combat sports), video games, and movies(TV shows go here too)! <br>
	  I was an elementary major but circumstances led me to an IT major and I have not looked back since. I hope to find a personally satisfying career in the field.

	  My preferred browser is Google Chrome, but I find Microsoft Edge to be decent.
